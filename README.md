# Conmath: Naive Constructive Mathematics

Welcome to the Conmath repository! This is a place for exploring and learning about constructive mathematics in a naive 
and experimental way.

## What is constructive mathematics?

Constructive mathematics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the construction of mathematical objects, rather 
than just their existence or properties. This approach is inspired by the intuitionistic approach to mathematical logic, 
which emphasizes the constructions and evidence behind mathematical statements.

# Introduction

This repository is a place for exploring and learning about constructive mathematics in a naive and experimental way.

# Computation

Constructive mathematics is closely related to computation, as it emphasizes the construction of mathematical objects and proofs. This connection has led to the development of computational interpretations of constructive mathematics, such as the Curry-Howard correspondence, which relates constructive proofs to computer programs.

# Mathematics
Mathematics is the domain of all languages, in the widest sense of the word.

## Arithmetic
Deals with numbers and basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Abstract Algebra
Deals with algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields.
