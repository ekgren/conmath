# Conmath: Naive Constructive Mathematical Explorations

Welcome to the Conmath repository! This is a place for exploring and learning about constructive mathematics in a naive 
and experimental way.

## What is constructive mathematics?

Constructive mathematics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the construction of mathematical objects, rather 
than just their existence or properties. This approach is inspired by the intuitionistic approach to mathematical logic, 
which emphasizes the constructions and evidence behind mathematical statements.

## What can I find in this repository?

In this repository, you will find a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that explore various topics in 
constructive mathematics. These notebooks are meant to be educational and experimental in nature, and are not 
necessarily rigorous or complete treatments of the topics covered.

## How can I contribute?

If you have an interest in constructive mathematics and would like to contribute to this repository, we welcome pull 
requests with new notebooks or suggestions for improvement. We also welcome issues and discussions on the topics 
covered here.

Thank you for visiting the Conmath repository! We hope you find it useful and enjoyable.
