"""
In computer science and computer programming, a data type (or simply type) is a "set" of possible values and a "set" of
allowed operations on it.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type

A set is the mathematical model for a collection of different things; a set contains elements or members, which can be
mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or
even other sets. The set with no element is the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton. A set may have
a finite number of elements or be an infinite set. Two sets are equal if they have precisely the same elements.

Sets are ubiquitous in modern mathematics. Indeed, set theory, more specifically Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory, has been
the standard way to provide rigorous foundations for all branches of mathematics since the first half of the 20th
century.
